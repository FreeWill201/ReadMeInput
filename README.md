## Description 

Repo includes functionality accesible through node, ran through VS Code that allows the User to create their own README.md file automatically after responding to prompts on Gitbash or Terminal depending on OS used. The User is prompted to record specified answers to specific sections in order to create a satisfactory README.md file.

## Installation

The functionality is made available by defining parameters inside javascript that speciify how the user is to be prompted for input to be applied to a README.md file. This is not possible without properly formatting everything in VS Code and installing necessarry packages through npm commands that allow the functionality to occur. Finally the user must respond to prompts accordingly to create a well structured README.md file.

## Usage

This functionality is aimed at the user who wants to quickly put together a README.md file that meets basic requirements of describing what their application is. It can also be used for someone unfamilar with how to properly format a README.md file so they can go about properly referencing their work. 

## Credits

Credits to Jquery and Javascript along with all Json packages. Without these it would not be possible to attain the functionality previosuly referenced. Furthermore without VS Code nothing would work and without GitHub the work could not be shared. Credits also go out to sites used for reference, Full Stack, Google, and Youtube.

## Features

Functionality accessed through available code on GitHub in VS Code allows the User to respond to prompts that write specified sections of a README.md file.

Finally a README.md file is locally created that corresponds to the User's input as previously referrenced.
